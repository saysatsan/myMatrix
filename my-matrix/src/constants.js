      "positive": "The energy of these individuals is a shining light for many people. They radiate positive energy, openness, and a desire to find joy in simple things. Being around them is always comfortable and enjoyable, which is why they are constantly surrounded by numerous people and are seen as leaders. They are capable of acting actively and achieving set goals. Life, in return for their light and joy, blesses these individuals with wealth and prosperity.",
      "negative": "In the negative aspect, they can become fixated on one thing in their life, whether it's a person or an event. From good intentions, they might become possessive, not leaving space for others to live and express themselves. An aggressively shining 'Sun' can burn everything around it or within itself. Another negative aspect is the tendency towards self-burning, as these individuals might attribute the source of all their failures to themselves. They either overextend their energy in advancing their cause or blame themselves for everything, becoming disappointed in their abilities and psychologically burning from within."

      "positive": "These individuals are responsible for working on the karma of their ancestors, fulfilling family tasks. When a person works on their karmic assignments (praying for the souls of the deceased), a channel of claircognizance opens up—a form of sensory perception where a person receives knowledge in unexpected ways. They are closely connected to the programs of their kind and often receive support from their relatives, both morally and materially. Prophetic dreams provide hints and information to them. They find everything unusual and unknown intriguing, possessing diverse interests. People endowed with extrasensory and mystical abilities, natural healers who understand the philosophy of life and death. They are talented and creative individuals, often experiencing moments of enlightenment.",
      "negative": "There is no middle ground in their destiny—they are either working on themselves and progressing upwards, or they feel suppressed. In the negative aspect, aggression is expressed, and they may condemn those around them. The downside of this energy is judgment and condemnation. They may try to impose their will on others, or conversely, lack their own inner core. They can be detached from the material world or, conversely, fixated on material things. They may neglect their spiritual development. Lack of support from family, repetition of ancestral scripts, depressive states, and illnesses can be part of their negative manifestations."

      "negative": "The negative aspect manifests as aggression, condemning people, and criticizing everything and everyone. It can also show up as rigidity and stereotypical thinking. These individuals can't proceed step by step; they want to achieve everything at once. They may confine themselves within limits, narrow their sphere of activity, influence, and development, and sometimes even close themselves off within four walls. Dissatisfaction with the world system, state, or even nations and religions. They may destroy the surrounding world without considering ecology. Sources of conflicts, both on a small scale and at a global level."
